# Displaying regular price alongside sale price in variable and grouped products
In most cases, when a product is on sale, WooCommerce displays the (crossed-out) regular price alongside the price on sale. This is a great way for customers to see how much they're saving on a product.

However, when it displays a price range (which can happen in variable and grouped products), it omits the regular price, displaying only the sale price.

The wc-price-range-sale.php file contains the final result of a tutorial on how to change WooCommerce's default behavior to display the regular price in variable and grouped products on sale too.
